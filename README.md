# IoT controlling LED with ESP8266 NodeMCU with on demand wifi configuration

A simple electronic configuration to control LED light using the internet with the help od
ESP8266 module (NodeMCU). Additional to the traditional LED control with Wifi, this project has a 
dynamic on demand wifi configuration to set and reset SSID and password for the IoT device.

## Installation

Install Arduino IDE from [arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

Set up your IDE to work with ESP modules. [circuits4you](https://circuits4you.com/2018/02/05/esp8266-arduino-wifi-web-server-led-on-off-control/)
is a great website that has helped me with it.

you can follow the video from Acknowledgements section for first time configuration.

This works with the ESP8266 Arduino platform

## üöÄ About Me
Hi...
I am [Md. Afraim Bin Zahangir](https://github.com/Afraim). Fresh CSE Gradute from university of Liberal Arts Bangladesh. Although I am a CSE student but working with Arduino and electronics is my hobby and I like to make things that I, myslef and others will use. If you have any idea that you think we can work together, feel free to knock me üòÅ.
